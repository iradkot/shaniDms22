# AGP Chart Layout and Axis Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chart Centering ✅
**Problem**: AGP chart was not centered properly
**Solution**: 
- Updated `ChartContainer` styling to include `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center`
- Added centered wrapper Views around AGP charts in TrendsMainContent with `alignItems: 'center'`

### 2. Chart Width ✅
**Problem**: Chart was not wide enough
**Solution**:
- Increased chart width calculation from `screenWidth - 40` to `screenWidth - 20` (minimal padding)
- Increased minimum width from 320 to 340 pixels
- Added `paddingHorizontal: 10` to chart containers for proper spacing

### 3. Y-Axis Labels Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Y-axis labels were not showing or poorly positioned
**Solutions**:
- Increased left margin from 60 to 70 pixels to provide more space
- Moved Y-axis labels further left (x: -15 instead of -8)
- Increased font size from 12 to 13 and weight to 600 for better visibility
- Added proper Y-axis line for clear boundary

### 4. X-Axis Labels Visibility ✅
**Problem**: X-axis labels were not showing well or overlapping
**Solutions**:
- Increased bottom margin from 40 to 50 pixels
- Moved X-axis labels further down (y: chartHeight + 35 instead of +25)
- Increased font size from 11 to 12 and weight to 500
- Simplified time labels to show every 4 hours instead of 2 hours for cleaner display
- Updated time labels to: ['12 AM', '4 AM', '8 AM', '12 PM', '4 PM', '8 PM']
- Added proper X-axis line for clear boundary

### 5. Chart Height and Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Chart was too short to see details clearly
**Solution**:
- Increased chart height from 200 to 220 pixels for basic AGP
- Enhanced AGP height increased to 240 pixels
- Better margin allocation provides more actual chart area

## Files Modified

### 1. Chart Styling
- `src/components/AGPGraph/styles/components.styles.ts`
  - Added centering to ChartContainer

### 2. Chart Configuration  
- `src/components/AGPGraph/utils/constants.ts`
  - Updated margins: left: 70, bottom: 50
  - Simplified time labels for better readability

### 3. Chart Axes Component
- `src/components/AGPGraph/components/chart/ChartAxes.tsx`
  - Added X-axis and Y-axis boundary lines
  - Improved label positioning and styling
  - Fixed syntax errors and cleaned up code

### 4. Main Chart Component
- `src/components/AGPGraph/components/AGPChart.tsx`
  - Passed chartWidth to ChartAxes component

### 5. Trends Layout
- `src/containers/MainTabsNavigator/Containers/Trends/components/TrendsMainContent.tsx`
  - Increased chart width calculation
  - Added centering wrapper Views
  - Increased chart heights

## Key Improvements Learned from CGM Graph

1. **Proper Margin Allocation**: CGM graph uses adequate margins for axis labels
2. **Axis Line Boundaries**: Clear X and Y axis lines help define chart boundaries  
3. **Label Positioning**: Labels positioned well outside chart area to avoid overlap
4. **Simplified Time Labels**: Fewer, clearer time labels prevent crowding
5. **Container Centering**: Proper flex alignment for centered chart display

## Expected Results

### Visual Improvements:
- ✅ Chart is properly centered within its container
- ✅ Chart uses almost full screen width (screen width - 20px)
- ✅ Y-axis labels are clearly visible on the left side
- ✅ X-axis labels are clearly visible below the chart
- ✅ Clean boundary lines define the chart area
- ✅ Time labels are spaced appropriately (every 4 hours)
- ✅ Overall professional appearance similar to CGM graph

### Technical Improvements:
- ✅ No syntax errors or compilation issues
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing for all new props
- ✅ Maintainable code structure
- ✅ Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## Testing Verification

To verify the improvements:

1. **Open Trends Screen**: Navigate to Trends → AGP sections
2. **Check Centering**: Chart should be centered horizontally
3. **Check Width**: Chart should span nearly full screen width
4. **Check Y-Axis**: Glucose values (70, 100, 140, 180, etc.) should be visible on left
5. **Check X-Axis**: Time labels (12 AM, 4 AM, 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM, 8 PM) should be visible below
6. **Check Boundaries**: Clear lines should define chart edges
7. **Check Spacing**: Labels should not overlap with chart content

All improvements follow the successful patterns used in the CGM graph implementation.
