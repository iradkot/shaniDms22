# Fix for Overlapping Bolus Labels & Improved Hover Detection

## Issue Identified
From user screenshot and feedback:
- **Overlapping unit labels:** Multiple bolus events close in time caused unit text (2, 5, 8) to overlap and become unreadable
- **Still difficult hover:** Even with combined tooltips, spatial hover detection was too restrictive
- **Visual clutter:** Always-visible unit labels made chart messy

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Overlapping Labels ✅
- **Removed:** Always-visible unit labels from `BolusItem.tsx`
- **Rationale:** Prevents overlapping text when multiple bolus events occur close together
- **Clean visual:** Now shows only sized diamond markers, units only in tooltips

### 2. Spatial Hover Detection ✅ 
- **Added:** `findClosestBolusWithSpatialProximity()` function in `bolusUtils.ts`
- **40px touch radius:** Much larger detection area around each bolus marker
- **Mobile-friendly:** Considers actual pixel distance, not just time proximity
- **Updated:** `CgmGraph.tsx` to use spatial detection instead of time-only

### 3. Preserved Visual Scaling ✅
- **Kept:** Size scaling based on bolus amount (larger marker = more insulin)
- **Maintained:** Orange diamond shape for visual distinction
- **Clean design:** No text clutter, rely on tooltips for detailed info

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
- **BolusItem.tsx:** Removed `<Text>` element showing unit labels, removed Text import
- **bolusUtils.ts:** Added `findClosestBolusWithSpatialProximity()` with 40px radius detection
- **CgmGraph.tsx:** Updated to use spatial proximity function for bolus hover detection
- **00_CONTEXT.md:** Updated documentation to reflect label removal and spatial detection

### Detection Algorithm:
```typescript
// Calculate pixel distance from touch to bolus marker
const pixelDistance = Math.sqrt(
  Math.pow(touchX - bolusX, 2) + Math.pow(touchY - bolusY, 2)
);

// Only consider boluses within touch distance (40px radius)
if (pixelDistance <= maxTouchDistance && pixelDistance < minDistance) {
  closestBolus = bolus;
}
```

## Expected Results
- **No more overlapping text:** Chart remains clean even with multiple close bolus events
- **Much easier hover/tap:** 40px radius makes bolus markers easy to touch on mobile
- **Visual scaling preserved:** Can still see relative insulin amounts by marker size
- **Tooltip shows units:** All detailed information available on hover/tap without visual clutter
- **Combined tooltips still work:** BG + bolus within 1 minute still show together

## Medical Safety
- **Data accuracy preserved:** All bolus amounts and timestamps still exact from Nightscout
- **Visual distinction maintained:** Orange diamonds clearly different from BG data points  
- **No calculation changes:** Only display/interaction improvements
- **Information still accessible:** All unit data available via tooltips

This fix addresses both usability (easier tapping) and visual clarity (no overlapping text) while maintaining all medical data accuracy.
