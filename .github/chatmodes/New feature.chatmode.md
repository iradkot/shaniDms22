# ShaniDms New Feature Development Mode (User-Centered & No-Git)

> **Policy:** Do **not** create commits, branches, or tags. Work only in the working tree.  
> **Philosophy:** User feedback drives design. Medical accuracy is non-negotiable. Plan before building.

## 0) Lifecycle (Agent Loop) - CRITICAL
**Harvest ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Document**  
- **STOP after PLAN** and wait for explicit `PROCEED` from user
- **Hard cap: ‚â§25 tool steps** per run. If blocked twice, reflect and ask guidance
- **User feedback is sacred** - if user says "too complicated", redesign completely

---

## 1) Health-App Critical Standards (Life-Critical)
- **Glucose constants:** `src/constants/PLAN_CONFIG.ts` ‚Äî *NEVER* hardcode values (55/70/140/180/250)
- **Rounding:** use `Math.round` for ALL percentages (medical consistency)  
- **Theme:** `src/style/colors.ts` + `useTheme()` ‚Äî *NO* hardcoded colors ever
- **User Experience:** Clear visual communication (use symbols like ‚â§40, ‚â•200 for boundaries)
- **Traceability:** Link each change to acceptance criteria. Log risks in compliance docs

---

## 2) Pre-Development Checklist (MANDATORY)
1. **üîç Explore User Intent FIRST**
   - What specific problem are they solving?
   - What's their mental model of the solution?
   - Are there simpler approaches than what they initially described?

2. **üèóÔ∏è Search for Precedent** (reuse > rewrite)
   - Similar components/hooks/utils/tests
   - Existing patterns in the codebase
   - UI/UX patterns already established

3. **üìã Collect Context** ‚Üí create `/docs/agent/00_CONTEXT.md`
   - Files likely to be touched
   - APIs, constants, types involved
   - Existing tests that might need updates
   - Integration points (which screens?)

4. **üìù Draft Plan** ‚Üí `/docs/agent/01_PLAN.prompt.md`
   - Goals & acceptance criteria
   - File-by-file changes with rationale
   - Test strategy
   - Risk assessment & mitigations
   - Rollback strategy

5. **üõ°Ô∏è Approval Gate**: Wait for `PROCEED` before any code changes
   - High-risk changes (medical logic) require explicit confirmation
   - Present alternatives if user feedback suggests different approach

---

## 3) Execution Rules (No-Git, User-Responsive)
- **Small, reversible edits** in working tree; keep related changes localized
- **Listen to user feedback immediately** - if they say it's wrong, stop and redesign
- **Separation of concerns**:  
  - Pure calculations ‚Üí `src/utils/`  
  - Data/IO ‚Üí `src/hooks/`  
  - UI components remain presentational
  - Screen integration last
- **Performance for health data**: linear passes on large BG arrays; memoize; avoid re-renders
- **Read-only git allowed** for insight: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log -p <file>`
- **Strictly forbidden**: `git commit`, `git push`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, etc.

---

## 4) User-Centered Design Principles
- **Clarity over complexity** - if user says "too complicated", simplify drastically
- **Visual communication** - use clear symbols, colors, and layouts
- **Medical context** - provide clinical interpretations for glucose ranges
- **Responsive design** - optimize for mobile diabetes management scenarios
- **Accessibility** - large touch targets, clear labels, readable fonts

---

## 5) Validation (Gate to "DONE")
- **Unit tests** (adjacent to source): calculations, rounding, edge cases
- **Integration tests**: data flow across hooks/components  
- **Medical validation**: threshold correctness against `PLAN_CONFIG`
- **User experience testing**: can user actually accomplish their goal?
- Run `runTests`; attach outputs to plan doc
- **Risk verification**: document medical safety controls

---

## 6) Documentation & Compliance (Health App Required)
- Update `/docs/agent/00_CONTEXT.md` with actual files touched
- Append results to `/docs/agent/01_PLAN.prompt.md`
- Create/update component README with usage examples
- Log medical risks in `/docs/compliance/RISK_LOG.md` (ISO-14971 style)

---

## 7) Tool-Use Strategy (Efficient & Reflective)
- **Start with exploration**: `search`, `codebase`, `usages`, `findTestFiles`
- **Build context before coding**: understand existing patterns first
- **Use `think` tool** when user feedback requires design changes
- **Reflect on failures**: if same tool fails twice, analyze and adjust approach
- **Document decisions**: why this approach vs alternatives

---

## 8) Testing for Health Compliance (Non-Negotiable)
- **Unit**: BG calculations, percentage rounding, boundary conditions
- **Integration**: hook ‚Üí component ‚Üí screen data flow
- **Medical validation**: only `PLAN_CONFIG` values used
- **Edge cases**: empty data, extreme values, null handling
- **UX validation**: user can actually complete their intended task
- **Naming**: descriptive test names; colocated `*.test.ts/tsx`

---

## 9) Context Documentation Template
Create/update `/docs/agent/00_CONTEXT.md`:
```md
# Context for [FEATURE_NAME]

## User Intent
- Original request:
- Underlying problem:
- Success criteria:

> Reply **PROCEED** to execute, or provide feedback to adjust plan.
```

---

## 11) Success Patterns (Learned from Experience)
- **Iterative refinement** based on immediate user feedback
- **Constants-first approach** - always check PLAN_CONFIG before hardcoding
- **Visual clarity** - use mathematical symbols (‚â§, ‚â•) for boundaries
- **Integration thinking** - consider where feature fits in user workflow
- **Performance awareness** - React Native patterns for smooth interactions
- **Documentation as you build** - keep README updated with each iteration

---

## 12) Final Checklist (No-Git Ready)
- [ ] User feedback fully incorporated (no "too complicated" issues remaining)
- [ ] No hardcoded glucose values (all via `PLAN_CONFIG.ts`)
- [ ] Percentages use `Math.round` consistently
- [ ] Theme-only colors; no inline hex values
- [ ] TypeScript strict; no `any` leaks
- [ ] Tests passing; logs in plan doc
- [ ] Clear visual communication (symbols, labels, interpretations)
- [ ] Medical risk assessment documented
- [ ] Component README updated with examples
- [ ] Integration completed appropriately

---

## 13) Reflection Points (Tool Step Management)
After every 10 tool calls, ask:
- Am I solving the user's actual problem?
- Is this getting too complicated for the user?
- Should I simplify the approach?
- Do I need user feedback before continuing?

**Remember: This is a life-critical diabetes management app. User experience and medical accuracy are equally important. When in doubt, ask the user.**
